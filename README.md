# README

This reposity contains a selection of functional programming exercises in javascript.

Currently the exercises are taken from the "learnrx" program, which can be found here: https://reactivex.io/learnrx/. I have made a few changes:
- I renamed the reduce method used in the exercises, which returns an item in an array, as reduceBox. This is to be distinct from the native reduce method which returns a value.
- I use flatMap and flat instead of concatMap and concatAll.
