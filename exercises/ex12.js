 * Exercise 12: Retrieve id, title, and a 150x200 box art url for every video
 *
 * You've managed to flatten a tree that's two levels deep, let's try for three! 
 * Let's say that instead of a single boxart url on each video, we had a collection of boxart objects, each with a different size and url. 
 * Create a query that selects {id, title, boxart} for every video in the movieLists. 
 * This time though, the boxart property in the result will be the url of the boxart object with dimensions of 150x200px. 
 * Let's see if you can solve this problem with map(), concatAll(), and filter().
 *
 * There's just more one thing: you can't use indexers. In other words, this is illegal:
 
   var itemInArray = movieLists[0];
			
 * Furthermore, you're not allowed to use indexers in any of the remaining exercises unless you're implementing one of the five functions. 
 * There is a very good reason for this restriction, and that reason will eventually be explained. 
 * For now, you'll simply have to accept it on faith that this restriction serves a purpose. :-)
