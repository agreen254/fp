/* 
 * Exercise 27: Stock Ticker
 *
 * Let's try an easier question. 
 * Let's say we have a collection of all of the prices for NASDAQ stocks over time. 
 * Every time the price of a stock changes on the NASDAQ ticker an entry is added to this collection. 
 * Let's say that ten days ago you bought shares in Microsoft, and now you want to print all of the MSFT share prices since then. 
 * Filter the collection for MSFT trades starting from ten days ago and print each price record (including the time stamp) using the print() function. 
 * Note: this is not a trick question. It's as easy as it seems.

    // The pricesNASDAQ collection looks something like this...
    var pricesNASDAQ = [
        // ... from the NASDAQ's opening day
        {name: "ANGI", price: 31.22, timeStamp: new Date(2011,11,15) },
        {name: "MSFT", price: 32.32, timeStamp: new Date(2011,11,15) },
        {name: "GOOG", price: 150.43, timeStamp: new Date(2011,11,15)},
        {name: "ANGI", price: 28.44, timeStamp: new Date(2011,11,16)},
        {name: "GOOG", price: 199.33, timeStamp: new Date(2011,11,16)},
        // ...and up to the present.
    ];

function ex27(pricesNASDAQ, printRecord) {
  var microsoftPrices,
    now = new Date(),
    tenDaysAgo = new Date(
      now.getFullYear(),
      now.getMonth(),
      now.getDate() - 10
    );

  // use filter() to filter the trades for MSFT prices recorded any time after 10 days ago
  microsoftPrices = pricesNASDAQ
    .filter((record) => record.name === "MSFT")
    .filter((record) => record.timeStamp > tenDaysAgo); // note this is greater than

  // Print the trades to the output console
  microsoftPrices.forEach(function (priceRecord) {
